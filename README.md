## External Resources

This project was made with assistance from MDL (https://material.io) (Material Design Lite) where a use of the imports would be more efficient, such as with advanced styling and
advanced HTML elements such as popups. Font Awesome was used for high-quality icons such as the search and social media logos. Firebase was used to support the entire backend,
including authentication, products, and user data.
